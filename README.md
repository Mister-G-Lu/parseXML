# parseXML

* This parses an XML file and puts the data inside a nested Map
* Versatile set up that prints out the Headers, labeling the empty headers with double dashes before and after (with correct indentation)
* Uses Panda Dataframe to print out each sub-table (with empty data as sub-tables or no data found)
